"<p><b>Quality (interpolation)</b><p>Select here the demosaicing RAW images "
"decoding interpolation method. A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image "
"process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data "
"received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital "
"cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA "
"interpolation or color reconstruction, another common spelling is "
"demosaicing. There are 4 methods to demosaicing RAW "
"images:<p><b>Bilinear</b>: use high-speed but low-quality bilinear "
"interpolation (default - for slow computer). In this method, the red value "
"of a non-red pixel is computed as the average of the adjacent red pixels, "
"and similar for blue and green.<p><b>VNG</b>: use Variable Number of "
"Gradients interpolation. This method computes gradients near the pixel of "
"interest and uses the lower gradients (representing smoother and more "
"similar parts of the image) to make an estimate.<p><b>PPG</b>: use Patterned "
"Pixel Grouping interpolation. Pixel Grouping uses assumptions about natural "
"scenery in making estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural images "
"than the Variable Number of Gradients method.<p><b>AHD</b>: use Adaptive "
"Homogeneity-Directed interpolation. This method selects the direction of "
"interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity metric, thus typically "
"minimizing color artifacts.<p>"
