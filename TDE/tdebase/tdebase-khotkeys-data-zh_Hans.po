"Read the comment on action \"Type 'Hello'\" first.\n"
"\n"
"Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows (maybe because MS Windows does "
"it that way *shrug*). But Ctrl+F4 in TDE stands for going to virtual desktop "
"4, so it doesn't work in Qt Designer, and also, Qt Designer doesn't use "
"TDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\n"
"\n"
"But the problem can be solved by remaping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active "
"window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is "
"pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, "
"Ctrl+W remains working the usual way of course.\n"
"\n"
"We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on 'Ctrl+W', a "
"new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the "
"active window is Qt Designer.\n"
"Qt Designer seems to always have title 'Qt Designer by Trolltech', so the "
"condition will check for the active window having that title."

"Ok, Konqi in TDE has tabs, and now you can also have gestures. No need to "
"use other browsers >;).\n"
"\n"
"Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, "
"and after you're finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to "
"paste the selection, it still works, simply only click the middle mouse "
"button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\n"
"\n"
"Right now, there are these gestures available:\n"
"move right and back left - Forward (ALt+Right)\n"
"move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\n"
"move up and back down  - Up (Alt+Up)\n"
"circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\n"
" (As soon as I find out which ones are in Opera or Mozilla, I'll add more "
"and make sure they are the same. Or if you do it yourself, feel free to help "
"me and send me your khotkeysrc.)\n"
"\n"
"The gestures shapes (some of the dialogs are from KGesture, thanks to Mike "
"Pilone) can be simply entered by performing them in the configuration "
"dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you, gestures are "
"recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\n"
"\n"
"Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. "
"Because of this, it's possible to enter more gestures for the action. You "
"should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of "
"mouse moving more than once (i.e. do e.g. 45654 or 74123 as they are simple "
"to perform but e.g. 1236987 may be already quite difficult).\n"
"\n"
"The condition for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures "
"are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains "
"'konqueror')."
