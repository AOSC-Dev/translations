"<body> <h1>Help for Extended applet security - itw-settings, files and "
"structures, dialogue</h1> <p> Extended Applet Security refers to security "
"features for unsigned applets. Traditionally, only signed applets required "
"user confirmation and unsigned applets ran automatically. This is "
"represented by the ''low security'' setting. Unsigned applets must be "
"allowed or disallowed individually on ''high security'' (the default), and "
"additionally do not run at all on ''very high security''. In theory, "
"unsigned applets can safely run automatically. In practice, however, any "
"vulnerability in the Java security sandbox will prevent this from being "
"true. </p> <p> To do so it uses  the <b>Security Level</b> main settings "
"switch rules in the tables of <b>Custom definitions</b> and <b>Global "
"definitions</b><br/> You can read much more about development of (and help "
"us to improve!) this feature at <a href=\"{3}\">dedicated IcedTea-Web page</"
"a> </p> <A name=\"level\"><h2>Security Level</h2></A> <p> Its a main switch "
"for \"extended applet security\". Its value is commonly stored in "
"users_home/.icedtea/deployment.properties, but can be enforced via global "
"settings in /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties or JAVA_HOME/lib/"
"deployment.properties under the key <b>deployment.security.level</b><br/> "
