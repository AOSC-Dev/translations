WineHQ
======

[WineHQ](http://winehq.org) Wine enables Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, and Solaris 
users to run Windows applications without a copy of Microsoft Windows. Wine 
is free software under constant development. Other platforms may benefit 
as well.

Submission
----------

The only possible way to submit Wine translations is through their 
`wine-patches` mailing list, with an attatchment containing a properly
formatted diff (patch) output.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to make the translation into the 
`wine-devel` list where Wine developers can merge in the new 
translations.
