WineHQ
======

[WineHQ](http://winehq.org) Wine enables Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, and Solaris 
users to run Windows applications without a copy of Microsoft Windows. Wine 
is free software under constant development. Other platforms may benefit 
as well.

Submission
----------

The only possible way to submit Wine translations is through their 
`wine-patches` mailing list, with an attatchment containing a properly
formatted diff (patch) output.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to make the translation into the 
`wine-devel` list where Wine developers can merge in the new 
translations.

Translation Notes
-----------------

To maintain consistency with Microsoft (R) Windows (R) Text, you should
read Microsoft (R)'s Style Guides first. Like all `zh_CN` translations,
you should also read our PDF.

Like what ReactOS guys say, 
> You don't have to translate everything exactly the same as Windows.
> If you believe you can translate something better than Windows, go on!
> However you are encouraged to keep common terms, like for example the
> menus in the windows.
>
> Also, Try to keep your translation consistent, i.e. try to not translate
> the same term differently in different places.

You can always improve the translations, for example the famous idiotic
zh_CN-MS term “内存不能为 read” (The memory cannot be read) should be
changed.
